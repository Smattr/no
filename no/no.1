.SH NAME
no \- Best-effort security sandbox
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \fBno\fR \fBoptions\fR -- \fIcommand\fR \fIargs...\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
No is a tool for disallowing certain file system and network operations to a
command. It does not provide strong security against a malicious process
attempting to subvert a sandbox. However its security boundary should be
sufficient to prevent buggy or simple unwanted behaviour.
.SH OPTIONS
\fB--[allow|disallow]-network\fR
.RS
Enable or disable use of networking by the command. The default is to disallow
networking.
.RE
.PP
\fB--allow-tmp-writes\fR
.RS
Allow file system writes to \fB$TMPDIR\fR. If no other file system options are
given, this will result in all paths outside of \fB$TMPDIR\fR being read-only.
A subsequent \fB--disallow-writes\fR option will override this and make
\fB$TMPDIR\fR read-only.
.RE
.PP
\fB--[allow|disallow]-writes\fR
.RS
Enable or disable write access to the file system. The default is to disallow
access. This will override any prior \fB--allow-tmp-writes\fR option, but a
subsequent \fB--allow-tmp-writes\fR will override this specifically for
\fB$TMPDIR\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fB--debug\fR
.RS
Enable debug mode. This is currently unimplemented.
